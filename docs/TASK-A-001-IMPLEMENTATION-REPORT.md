## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### Core Algorithm Optimizations

#### Batch Processing Enhancement
```javascript
// Before: Sequential processing
for (const tab of tabs) {
  await processTab(tab);
}

// After: Parallel batch processing with controlled concurrency
const results = await globalTabParallelProcessor.processParallel(
  tabs, 
  processTab, 
  { 
    batchSize: 15,
    maxConcurrency: 8,
    itemConcurrency: 5 
  }
);
```

#### Smart Debouncing Implementation
```javascript
// Enhanced debouncing with memory management
function checkMemoryLimitBeforeAdd(key) {
  if (debouncedTitleUpdaters.size >= MAX_DEBOUNCED_ENTRIES) {
    // Remove oldest entries to prevent memory leaks
    const entriesToRemove = Math.min(10, currentSize - MAX_DEBOUNCED_ENTRIES + 10);
    // ... cleanup logic
  }
  return true;
}
```

#### Performance Monitoring Integration
```javascript
// Real-time performance validation
const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
recordPerformanceMetric("processTabQueue", duration, tabIds.length, {
  tabsProcessed: tabsToProcess.length,
  windowsProcessed: Object.keys(tabsByWindow).length
});

// Automatic target validation
if (tabIds.length <= 100 && duration > target100) {
  Logger.warn(`⚠️ Performance below target: ${duration}ms > ${target100}ms`);
}
```
